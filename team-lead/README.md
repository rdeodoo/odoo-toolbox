# Being a team leader

## Put others first, always

Stop doing what you are doing when someone ask for help.

If you can't figure something for someone, dig yourself until you find the
solution. Don't ask them to figure things for you. You are here to serve them,
not the other way.

## Overestimate their time, underestimate yours

Make it crystal clear that they are not wasting your time when they ask for your
time.\
Make it clear that asking for your help/time is a **magic life hack** that turns
1 hour into 5 hours. You will "waste" 1 hour, but they will "gain" 5 hours worth
of experience. It's _that_ magic!

The "end game" goal is to have your team members as valuable as you are.\
While your time is more valuable short term, any of your time you can offer to
someone is like a seed. It will be multiplied long term.\
Invest now, benefit later. If you don't, you'll get overwhelmed and fall behind
over time.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure they are on track to become autonomous. They should always research
> a bit by themselves before asking for help. There is a thin balance to find.


## Your goal is to become useless

You should elevate your team, not make them dependent of you. If this was a
game, the end goal would be for you to make them all fully autonomous and not
needing anything from you.

You should make it so:
- They have enough self-confidence to speak up in the company on their own
- They learnt everything they had to learn from you, process wise, vision wise
  or technically

If you feel irreplaceable, or feel that if you were not there things would go
south, it means your work is either:
- **not finished**: if you have newcomers, they obviously need you, it's a repeat
                process with every newcomer
- or **not done properly**: if you only have "old" persons in your team, and they
  still need you more than "very rarely", something is wrong. Wrong with you, or
  wrong with them. But something is to "fix".

## Work for them, don't have them work for you

If **people work for you**, you are just a useless part of the chain /
hierarchy.\
You probably bring close to no value, and if you were not there, people could do
their job and report to someone else instead.

If **you work for people**, you are elevating them, empowering them. You'd be
adding a few more horse power in their engine.

Good:
- Someone is stuck on something for hours, you check with them but can't help
  them quickly. Ask them to work on something else while you are looking for a
  solution **for them**. Of course, don't just provide the solution, explain how
  you found it.
- Review their code, be picky, **take every opportunity** to share more than you
  should. Maybe they know, maybe they don't.


Bad:
- Constantly ask people to report to you about what they do, their progress, ..
- Try to find someone else to help someone instead of helping yourself. Don't
  just be a dispatcher.

## Take the hits for your team

If someone do something wrong while doing their best, you should always take
responsibility and "shield" your team.

Act as if it was your own fault, not theirs.

Everyone do mistakes, as long as it's not happening too frequently, make sure
they don't feel too bad about it. Take the chance to teach them "internally"
after sorting out the issue for them.

For instance, if someone accidentally deletes a client database, while always
being cautious, motivated, dedicated and doing their best, and if both the
client and the top management are getting furious, you should intervene and take
the blame.

Your team, your responsibility.

## Identify their gaps

When you have the chance, you should dig into what they don't know.

It's impossible for someone to ask you about something they don't know,
because.. they don't know.\
It's your job to read between the lines and to always go further than what they
asked. Take every opportunity to cover more than the initial request.\

Pay attention to everything, for instance while you look at people navigating in
their IDE, shell or browser, spot the shortcuts or tools that you would use to
save time that they don't use, and make sure to at least mention it so they
know (maybe they do).

For instance:
- if you see someone struggling to retrieve a previous command in his shell,
  ensure they know about CTRL+R reverse search and/or `history-search-backward`
  (FN+up arrow)\
  See my keyboard [shortcut page](../misc-tips/keyboard-shortcuts.md)
- if you see someone manually navigating on odoo.com to go to a task ID, or
  manually going through runbot search to find a PR/branch, ensure they know
  about browser search shortcut\
  See my browser [shortcut page](../misc-tips/browser-shortcuts.md)

## Avoid authoritarian management

You should never make people feel like there is an authority relationship
between you and them.\
This is not pleasant for them. This is scary.\
Be a big brother, don't be a policeman.

If people take this as a weakness and try to take advantage of it in any way,
that's generally a good sign that this person shouldn't be in the company. You
can expect toxicity to always be near with that kind of person.

## Identify pain points

**Listen to your team**: they are always the key. Figure where they are wasting time
in the processes. Figure what is making their day harder or their work annoying.

**But also don't listen to your team:** read between the lines, and don't take
everything as-is. Keep in mind, humans are naturally resistant to changes. They
also like to complain to feel better. Some people will show off by putting
others down.

At the end, try to make their life easier.

## Reduce processes and rules, don't add more

A typical human reaction in management is to add a process whenever something
goes wrong, to be sure it's documented and doesn't happen again.

Most of the time, it's a (very) bad solution. You should educate people and let
them do mistake so they can learn.

Having countless documents, knowledge articles are quickly going out of control.
It's also a terrible and frightening experience for newcomers, they will feel
overwhelmed.

It's the same for processes, automate what you can, reduce manual burden. If you
can remove a step, do it.

## Be dedicated to the company

Odoo is a freaking awesome company. If it's your first company, you are probably
miles away to realizing it.\

Make sure people understand it.\
Make sure people don't think the company owes them everything while they don't
owe the company anything.\
Working in Odoo is a win-win relationship, it's one of your top priority to make
sure people realize that.\

We have:
- infinite freedom
- as close of a flat hierarchy as it can get
- accessible top level management
- freedom of talk
- paid team sport activities
- paid regular team building & after work
- while the salaries are not always the best, we are spoiled with extra benefits
  in most offices:
  - free lunch
  - free fruits & snacks
  - free beers after work
  - rooftop/swimming pool/fitness in some offices
  - very nice 401k matching and insane HSA contribution in the US

It's a company, and not a non-profit one, so nothing is perfect, but it
certainly is way better than average companies.

## Preserve the Odoo culture

This is your n°1 priority, by far. It's not even close.\
You can recover from everything: bad processes, bad technical people, bad
project, etc. But it's close to impossible to recover from a bad mindset /
culture, especially if persisted for some time.

This is the most valuable asset Odoo (as a company) has. Fight for it.

> [!TIP]
> As this is the most valuable asset we have, act quick when it's threatened.
> This might require firing people sooner than later. Toxicity spread faster
> than you'd think, and it will hurt the good members' productivity and mindset.

## Know your team skills

Have a perfectly clear overview of what each member in your team is capable of.

You should be able to have a good idea on who is developing quick, technically
better, helping others more, has a good company culture.\
It shouldn't be too hard for you to sort your team members in order on the
"expectation scale" we use in Odoo (NI, ME, EE..).

> [!TIP]
> Remember: there is not a single way for someone to exceed expectation

## Put the spotlight on them, not on you

If you are a TL, you already gained the company's trust. Don't take credit for
everything your team is doing. Do the opposite. Fully credit them when you are
doing something together, let them shine.

Stay in the shadow, make them shine. They will see what you do, they will be
grateful, they will naturally make sure what you do is known to others, that's
how you'll get some recognition back.

## Let people decide

Whenever possible, let them decide. Give them responsibilities. Let them take
ownership. They will


--- TODO ---
- Try to detect if someone is uncomfortable with something, someone, but doesn't
  speak up.
- Have a feeling at what everyone is producing: code wise (technical level,
  quantity, speed, complexity..), help wise (spending time help others), without
  relying on KPIs. KPIs can (and will) be faked. Trust your guts. See beyond the
  surface.

- Keeping some things you know just for you, to keep an edge on your team. This
  one is the worst thing you can do, by far.


- Never feel like you are taking someone as stupid when you explain them things, don't hesitate to ask them if they know something obvious, or don't even ask and tell them.

- Let people fail, fully trust them, give them full responsibilities, fix mistakes, don't try to prevent it by all mean
