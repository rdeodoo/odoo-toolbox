# Being a team leader

In Odoo, being a team lead is not about managing people. We fully trust people
until they give us a reason not to. There is no micromanagement, no authority,
no hierarchy.

This is a tough role, because whatever you read about "being a good manager"
won't apply here. Odoo "management" is truly unique and in many ways opposite
to what is usually done in companies:
- no corporate bullshit, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and focus on the product
- no useless recurring meetings
- little to no KPIs
- flat hierarchy
- full trust and autonomy are given by default, people don't have to earn it,
  they just have to not lose it

> [!TIP]
> With 60%+ growth year after year, a lot of people will become TL soon.

This role isn’t easy, and new team leads are appointed regularly. Having been a
team lead for over five years - first in the Belgian Website R&D team, then in
the Buffalo PS Tech department - I’ve outlined the key principles to keep in
mind when leading a team at Odoo.

Hopefully this will help you understand better:
- if you are a TL: what is expected from you as a TL
- if you are not a TL yet: understand your TL better and know what to expect

## Put others first, always

Stop doing what you are doing when someone asks for help.

If you can't figure something out for someone, dig yourself until you find the
solution. Don't ask them to figure things out for yourself. You are here to
serve them, not the other way around.

## Overestimate their time, underestimate yours

Make it crystal clear that they are not wasting your time when they ask for it.\
Make it clear that asking for your help/time is a **magic life hack** that turns
1 hour into 5 hours. You will "waste" 1 hour, but they will "gain" 5 hours worth
of experience. It's _that_ magic!

The "end game" goal is to have your team members as valuable as you are.\
While your time is more valuable short-term, any of your time you can offer to
someone is like a seed. It will be multiplied long-term.\
Invest now, benefit later. If you don't, you'll get overwhelmed and fall behind
over time.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure they are on track to become autonomous. They should always research
> a bit by themselves before asking for help. There is a thin balance to find.


## Your goal is to become useless

You should elevate your team, not make them dependent on you. If this was a
game, the end goal would be for you to make them all fully autonomous and not
needing anything from you.

You should make it so:
- They have enough self-confidence to speak up in the company on their own
- They learnt everything they had to learn from you, process-wise, vision-wise
  or technically

If you feel irreplaceable, or feel that if you were not there things would go
south, it means your work is either:
- **not finished**: if you have newcomers, they obviously need you, it's a repeat
                process with every newcomer
- or **not done properly**: if you only have "experienced" people in your team,
  and they still need you more than "very rarely", something is wrong.\
  Wrong with your way of working, or wrong with their way of working. But
  something needs to be fixed.

## Work for them, don't have them work for you

If **people work for you**, you are just a useless part of the chain /
hierarchy.\
You probably bring close to no value, and if you were not there, people could do
their job and report to someone else instead.

If **you work for people**, you are elevating them, empowering them. You'd be
adding a few more horsepower in their engine.

Good:
- Someone is stuck on something for hours, you check with them but can't help
  them quickly. Ask them to work on something else while you are looking for a
  solution **for them**. Of course, don't just provide the solution, explain how
  you found it.
- Review their code, be picky, **take every opportunity** to share more than you
  should. Maybe they know, maybe they don't.


Bad:
- Constantly ask people to report to you about what they do, their progress, ..
- Try to find someone else to help someone instead of helping them yourself.
  Don't just be a dispatcher.

## Take the hits for your team

If someone does something wrong while doing their best, you should always take
responsibility and "shield" your team.

Act as if it was your own fault, not theirs.

Everyone does mistakes, as long as it's not happening too often, make sure they
don't feel too bad about it. Take the opportunity to teach them "in private",
after sorting out the issue for them.

For instance, if someone accidentally deletes a client database, while always
being cautious, motivated, dedicated and doing their best, and if both the
client and the top management are getting furious, you should intervene and take
the blame.

Your team, your responsibility.

## Identify their gaps

When you have the chance, you should dig into what they don't know.

It's impossible for someone to ask you about something they don't know,
because.. they don't know.\
It's your job to read between the lines and to always go further than what they
asked. Take every opportunity to cover more than the initial request.

Pay attention to everything, for instance while you look at people navigating
through their IDE, shell or browser, spot the shortcuts or tools that you would
use to save time that they don't use, and make sure to at least mention it so
they know (maybe they do).

For instance:
- if you see someone struggling to retrieve a previous command in his shell,
  ensure they know about CTRL+R reverse search and/or `history-search-backward`
  (FN+up arrow)\
  👉 See my keyboard [shortcut page](../misc-tips/keyboard-shortcuts.md)
- if you see someone manually navigating on odoo.com to go to a task ID, or
  manually going through runbot search to find a PR/branch, ensure they know
  about browser search shortcut\
  👉 See my browser [shortcut page](../misc-tips/browser-shortcuts.md)

## Avoid authoritarian management

You should never make people feel like there is an authority relationship
between you and them.\
This is not pleasant for them. This is scary.\
Be a big brother, don't be a policeman.

If people take this as a weakness and try to take advantage of it in any way,
that's generally a good sign that this person shouldn't be in the company.
Toxicity is usually nearby with that kind of person.

## Identify pain points

**Listen to your team**: they are always the key. Figure out where they are
wasting time in the processes. Figure out what is making their day harder or
their work annoying.

**But also don't listen to your team:** read between the lines, and don't take
everything as-is. Keep in mind, humans are naturally resistant to change. They
also like to complain to feel better. Some people will show off by putting
others down.

At the end, try to make their life easier.

## Reduce processes and rules, don't add more

A typical human reaction in management is to add a process whenever something
goes wrong, to be sure it's documented and doesn't happen again.

Most of the time, it's a (very) bad solution. You should educate people and let
them make mistakes so they can learn.

Having countless documents, knowledge articles are quickly getting out of
control. It's also a terrible and frightening experience for newcomers, they
will feel overwhelmed.

It's the same for processes, automate what you can, reduce manual burden. If you
can remove a step, do it.

## Be dedicated to the company

Odoo is a freaking awesome company. If it's your first company, you are probably
miles away from realizing it.

Make sure people understand it.\
Make sure people don't think the company owes them everything while they don't
owe the company anything.\
Working in Odoo is a win-win relationship, it's one of your top priorities to
make sure people realize that.

We have:
- infinite freedom
- as close to a flat hierarchy as it can get
- accessible top-level management
- freedom of talk
- paid team sport activities
- paid regular team building & after-work
- while the salaries are not always the best, we are spoiled with extra benefits
  in most offices:
  - free lunch
  - free fruits & snacks
  - free beers after-work
  - rooftop/swimming pool/fitness in some offices
  - very nice 401k matching and insane HSA contribution in the US

It's a company, and not a non-profit one, so nothing is perfect, but it
certainly is way better than average companies.

## Preserve Odoo's culture

This is your n°1 priority, by far. It's not even close.\
You can recover from everything: bad processes, bad technical people, bad
projects, etc. But it's close to impossible to recover from a bad mindset /
culture, especially if persisted for some time.

This is the most valuable asset Odoo (as a company) has. Fight for it.

> [!TIP]
> As this is the most valuable asset we have, act quickly when it's threatened.
> This might require firing people sooner than later. Toxicity spreads faster
> than you'd think, and it will hurt the good members' productivity and mindset.

## Know your team skills

Have a perfectly clear overview of what each member of your team is capable of.

You should be able to have a good idea of who is developing quickly, technically
better, helping others more, has a good company culture.\
It shouldn't be too hard for you to sort your team members in a specific order
on the "expectations scale" we use in Odoo (NI, ME, EE..).

> [!TIP]
> Remember: there is not a single way for someone to exceed expectations

## Put the spotlight on them, not on you

If you are a TL, you already gained the company's trust. Don't take credit for
everything your team is doing. Do the opposite. Fully credit them when you are
doing something together, let them shine.

Stay in the shadow, make them shine. They will see what you do, they will be
grateful, they will naturally make sure that what you do is known to others,
that's how you'll get some recognition back.

## Give full trust

This is part of Odoo's culture, full trust is given by default. We trust people
until they give us a reason not to.

In other companies, people have to "earn" trust. Not here.

## Pay attention to the silent signals

Not everyone will tell you when something feels off.\
Try to spot the subtle details: someone suddenly quieter in meetings, avoiding
a topic, hesitating before answering, or looking tense around certain people.\
Gently check in, one-on-one, without pressure. Most of the time, they'll open up
if they feel safe. That's your job: create that space.

## Trust your instinct more than KPIs

Part of your job is to evaluate your team, ranking them from low to high
performers.

You should have a natural sense of what each person is doing: how they code,
how fast they move, the complexity they can handle, whether they help others,
and their overall impact.

Don't rely on KPIs for that, they are easy to fake and never captures the full
picture.\
Instead, trust your gut, your observations, your daily interactions. Don't just
look at commits or tickets. Look at attitude, curiosity, consistency,
ownership.\
That's how you really know your team.

## Never gatekeep knowledge

Don't keep tricks, shortcuts, or insights for yourself just to "stay ahead."
That's the **worst move** you can ever make as a leader.

When you learn something useful, share it right away. The more your team knows,
the stronger you become as a group.

## Assume nothing, explain everything

Never worry about "insulting" someone by explaining something they might already
know. Just ask casually, or even better, explain it directly.\
Most people appreciate clarity way more than you think.\
And if they already knew it? It's fine, it was a good refresher.

## Let them fall, but catch them fast

Give full trust. Let them take ownership. Let them fail, that's how people learn
and grow. That's how people fall in love with this company.

Your job isn't to prevent every mistake; it's to be available to help and fix
things quickly when something goes wrong and make sure they learn from it
without fear.\
As with everything, soak the pressure, take the hit for them. People naturally
think mistakes are not tolerated. Make sure they know it's not the case.

> [!WARNING]
> If someone constantly makes the same mistake over and over, it's a sign that
> either they are not fit for the company, or you are not doing your job
> properly as a TL. Act accordingly.

## Let people go

If someone is not fit for the company, don't hesitate too long. The longer you
wait, the more damage they will do to the company culture and productivity.

Worse: you are not doing them a favor. You are making them stay in a place where
they don't belong, and they can very well feel it every day, in the vast
majority of cases.\
There is nothing worse than feeling stuck somewhere where you feel like you are
a burden for others.\
Change your mindset: letting them go will allow them to find a place where they
will fit perfectly and be happier.
