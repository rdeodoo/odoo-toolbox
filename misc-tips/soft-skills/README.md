## Sending and Receiving Feedback

If I had to mention only one soft skill that is the most important, it would be
this one.

I don't believe there is any room for improvement if you are not able to receive
feedback properly, and if you are not able to send it properly.

Giving feedback isn’t always easy, it’s often even harder than receiving it.\
But it’s how we grow and move forward as a team.

Don’t be afraid to point out what doesn’t work, as long as it’s done
respectfully and constructively.\
And most importantly: bring something with it. If you raise a problem, try to
offer a solution, an idea, or at least a direction.

Sometimes you might wonder: “Should I really say something here?”, maybe you're
unsure you're right, or hesitant because of who you're talking to.\
It's easy: the fact you think there is something to say is enough to just say
it.\
**Don’t overthink it, just speak up. Your input matters.**
